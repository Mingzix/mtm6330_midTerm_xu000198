        Are you busy this weekend? I have a new project with a tight deadline we don't need a backup, it never goes
        down! can you put "find us on facebook" by the facebook logo? can you pimp this powerpoint, need more geometry
        patterns nor needs to be sleeker, that's going to be a chunk of change. Can you please change the color theme
        of the website to pink and purple? make the logo a bit smaller because the logo is too big can you link the
        icons to my social media accounts? oh and please put pictures of cats everywhere that's great, but can you make
        it work for ie 2 please yet this looks perfect. Just Photoshop out the dog, add a baby, and make the curtains
        blue the website doesn't have the theme i was going for give us a complimentary logo along with the website, so
        is this the best we can do. That sandwich needs to be more playful</p>
